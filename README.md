## Contributions

This software application is developed by Kuang-Chen Lu (me) and [Shriram Krishnamurthi](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/).

The design is originally based on the systems designed by Shriram and [John Clements](https://www.brinckerhoff.org/).
The original design can be found in the following publication:

> Clements, John, and Shriram Krishnamurthi. "Towards a Notional Machine for Runtime Stacks and Scope:
When Stacks Donâ€™t Stack Up." Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Conference on
International Computing Education Research-Volume 1. 2022.

During the revision of the design, numerous people have contributed feedback, notably:

- Students who attended [CSCI1730 in 2022](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2022/)
